  OMG is a complex project, with different value proposals. Explore the
  different aspects of the network, presented for each profile, below:

# OMG Network Knowledge Base

* Investor:
  * OMG is an ERC20 token whose main function is to be staked. Staking the token means purchasing an arbitrary amount of tokens, and put it at stake to validate the transactions going on the network, generating passive revenues for its owner. _go a bit more in depth about staking, then links to the KB to dive deeper_
  * It is backed by Omise, an established South-East Asia company, already running transactions for over XX merchants. While they are currently running theirs txs on their own network, they'll eventually migrate them to the OMG network to lower their costs \(link to roadmap\).
  * While a lot of blockchain projects start without actual usage, OMG is practically assured to have some tx from the get go. Read the roadmap \(link\) for more information about the different stages of the launch.
  * OMG is also partnering with other projects/companies to provide an easy access to their network, enabling 3rd parties to access their DEX \(decentralized exchange, enabling currency exchanges instantly and seemlessly for the end user, include link to the KB\) and the eWallet SDK \(toolkit provided to other companies to interact with the blockchain, enabling among other things to create a reward program or top up a shop-specific account, include link to KB\) . More to be announced about the partnerships ~soon~. All these partner's txs would be run on the OMG network, tx fees being redistributed amongst stakers \(OMG will be staking 20% of the tokens themselves\). _insert explanation of the staking fees system, where fees are set by stakers_
* Technologist:
  * OMG is leading the Ethereum research on Plasma, a layer-2 scaling solution \(link for "layer-2"\) that would enable a much higher throughput of transactions, ultimately secured on the Ethereum chain \(root chain\). _link to learn more about plasma_
  * Thanks to Plasma, an efficient DEX backend will be built, on top of which any front end could plug in.
  * The eWallet SDK is a toolkit provided by 3rd parties to build applications that interact with the OMG network, allowing access to the DEX and enabling anyone to create its own "currency" or rewards program on the network.
  * Fully open source, check the repos here and there \(links\)
* Blockchain enthusiast:
  * OMG's core values are aligned with its baseline "Unbank the banked" which is to provide a way to exchange values anywhere in the world, even to people who can't afford to be included in the banking system. While it is _not_ an "anti-bank" movement, it intends to democratize access to basic financial services, targetting first SEA as it is an ever growing market with a real need for such service \(include link, and this one should be rephrased, you obviously know better\)
  * OMG has proven a deep implication in the Ethereum ecosystem by giving a grant to the ECF \(iirc\) and being involved with Ethereum founders and core team since 20XX. It also shares its mission by building a fully decentralized network, completely open source.
* Conclusion: This post might have given a better overview of what OMG is building in this very young and fast-growing space. There is obviously a lot more to it, to dive deeper, check out the KB \(link\) and engage by joining our awesome community \(link to... reddit?!\)
