# Token burning

OmiseGO will act as operator during the initial PoA phase of the Tesuji OMG Network. Though in the majority of PoA chains operators profit from transaction fees, OmiseGO has chosen not to. OmiseGO's intention is that any profits to it from the network will come from staking, in the same way as any other stakers. Transaction fees are necessary in order to deter DDoS attacks \(intentional overloading of the network with spam transactions\). However, profits from fees during the PoA phase will be used to buy OMG tokens which will then be burned \(permanently removed from circulation, resulting in a decrease in total supply\).
