Increased complexity comes with increased risk, which is why OmiseGO has chosen to start with the simplest possible consensus mechanism for the initial Plasma implementation \("Tesuji"\): Proof of Authority \(PoA\), with OmiseGO as operator. Once OmiseGO has a battle-tested foundation, it will transition the consensus mechanism into hybrid Proof of Stake \(PoS\) and ultimately full PoS.
