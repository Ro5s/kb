The initial Tesuji launch is fairly basic and there will be a number of rapid iterations as well as DEX implementation to follow.

## PoA 
PoA is currently on internal testnet. OmiseGO has committed to continue to share audit results (as already done with the "mostly-done Quantstamp audits") and be open about progress on PoA development. 

## Move from PoA to PoS
OmiseGO has committed to move from PoA to PoS once they are satisfied that PoS is safe for stakers and users as Tesuji develops through rapid iterations. Further, OmiseGO has noted that it doesnâ€™t make sense to finalize the PoS design until the DEX design has been built out to some extent. In terms of reporting development toward PoS, OmiseGO has clarified that "[n]ews about progress on Plasma or the DEX is also news of progress toward PoS."
