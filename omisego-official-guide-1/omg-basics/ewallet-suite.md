# eWallet Suite

White-label Wallet Software Development Kit \(SDK\) The SDK provides standardized features to so-called digital wallet service providers. We will add more and more to this top layer as a “standard base” for others to build applications upon. While we must start somewhere, it is our ultimate goal to simplify the creation of new digital wallets to the point where they require little to no developer support.
