# Scalability Network Mechanism

Scalability Network Mechanism Above all else, OMG is a scaling solution for Ethereum finance. OMG was designed for the Plasma architecture, which structures blockchain computation into MapReduce functions and uses a combination of proof-of-stake token bonding, fraud proofs to reduce the costs of computation, a withdrawal design to efficiently counter network attacks, and the network security provided by Ethereum as the root chain to safely enable unprecedented transaction and on-chain exchange processing speed and scale.
