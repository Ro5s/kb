# Tengen: the end game

The Tengen milestone is the “end game” milestone when the OMG network will be able to support sufficient transactions per second to compete with traditional financial services, have a decentralized exchange with cash-in/cash-out capabilities and interoperability with different blockchains. In the Tengen development phase, Tesuji will be deployed on the finished OMG network: a massively-scalable, cross-chain-compatible decentralized exchange (DEx) Plasma chain.
