# Business development

OmiseGO takes an integrated approach to community engagement and business development. "True crypto projects build communities, not consumers." It also becomes difficult to separate community engagement from business development when you are simultaneously creating a completely free and open source product and an n-sided marketplace; your success depends on the health of a complex ecosystem of partners and collaborators; and your product is equally aimed at enterprise providers and individuals operating entirely free of intermediaries.

Implementing this approach, OmiseGO has done no paid marketing \(including bounties\) and provided no discounts during its crowdsale to anyone, including VCs and media groups. Nonetheless, the OmiseGO subreddit and Twitter account have the highest subscription rates of any Ethereum project so far.   

Notable examples of OmiseGO Community/BizDev: 

* [@APompliano](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/957262065768550402): "The most intelligent engineers I know are all incredibly excited about OmiseGo \(OMG\). It is the number one token they talk about. I find it interesting that the platform they see the most long term value in is rarely discussed publicly." \(6:40 AM - 27 Jan 2018 \| 353 Retweets \| 1,398 Likes\) \([@omise\_go responded](https://twitter.com/omise_go/status/957523890942574592)\)
* [Stripe, Inc.](https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support): "Despite this, we remain very optimistic about cryptocurrencies overall. There are a lot of efforts that we view as promising and that we can certainly imagine enabling support for in the future. We’re interested in what’s happening with Lightning and other proposals to enable faster payments. OmiseGO is an ambitious and clever proposal; more broadly, Ethereum continues to spawn many high-potential projects." \(Stripe, _Ending Bitcoin Support_, 23 Jan 2018\) \([@omise\_go responded](https://twitter.com/omise_go/status/955898487308079104?lang=en)\)
