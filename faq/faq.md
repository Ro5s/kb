## What does OmiseGO have planned for Q4 of this year?

](https://www.reddit.com/r/omise_go/comments/779wsl/what_does_omisego_have_planned_for_q4_of_this_year/dokx96a/â€‹)Like has been said many times now: big projects almost always don't make their deadlines. That's why most projects follow the golden rule: no dates on the roadmap. Q1, 2, 3, 4 is sometimes even to precise and won't be met. So it's nice to speculate on a release date, but don't make to much of a big deal out of it. If you scream now Q4 and it will be later, it will bite you in the ass, because OMG price will take a hit for the FUD a delay creates. People are way to impatient. And everybody who feel they got the "right" to be updates, don't get ahead of yourself. You put money in speculation, you not a stockholder. Get that straight for yourself.

And most important: complaining and bitching won't help you get the price up, 9 out of 10 times it will dip the price instead adding something productive to the project.
